### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Building on your existing skills joining tables, using basic functions, grouping data, and using subqueries, the next step in SQL, explore a database and the data in it. Using data from Stack Overflow, Fortune 500 companies, and 311 help requests from Evanston, get familiar with numeric, character, and date/time data types. Functions to aggregate, summarize, and analyze data without leaving the database. Errors and inconsistencies. Solving common problems to look for and strategies to clean up messy data. Be ready to start exploring your own PostgreSQL databases and analyzing the data in them.

#### This repository includes the following steps:

* Exploring a database by identifying the tables and the foreign keys that link them. Look for missing values, count the number of observations, and join tables to understand how they're related. You will see coalescing and casting data along the way.

* Build on functions like min and max to summarize numeric data in new ways. Add average, variance, correlation, and percentile functions to the toolkit, truncate and round numeric values too. Build complex queries and save your results by creating temporary tables.

* Text, or character, data can get messy, learn how to deal with inconsistencies in case, spacing, and delimiters. Learn how to use a temporary table to recode messy categorical data to standardized values you can count and aggregate. Extract new variables from unstructured text as you explore help requests submitted to the city of Evanston.

* Aggregate date/time data by hour, day, month, or year and practice both constructing time series and finding gaps in them.
